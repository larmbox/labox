# Introduction

Labox is a component library for Vue.js version 3. The project is primarily developed and maintained by the [Larmbox](https://larmbox.com) team. New components and features are considered and implemented as required by the Larmbox team.

Labox is designed to be fully customizeable with support for custom themes and configurations.

## Documentation

This documentation aims to give you an overview of available components of Labox and instructions on how to use them. Each component has a _Component Reference_ section that lists all available props, events and slots for the component.

Each example includes a code snippet. Each snippet can be edited by clicking the **Edit** button inside the snippet. Once you make changes, they will be reflected instantly in the preview.
